%Bacheloroppgave som videreføring av høstprosjekt: ”Arbeidsfordelingen” mellom de to emnene (fagene) beskrives her.
This bachelors assignment is written as the finalisation of our degree in computer science at NTNU. The motivation for this project from the group's point of view came from the desire to work with containerisation and new technologies. Since containerisation is one of the big new buzzwords this was a good opportunity to get acquainted with it. There is little focus on new technologies like this in the students' curriculum, so the participants of the project felt this was a good way to familiarise themselves with technology they will likely use in the future.


First of all we would like to thank our project supervisor Jan Harald Nilsen, for his help and advisory during our thesis. Secondly we would also like to extend thanks to Trondheim Municipality, especially Runar Andersstuen for their counsel and accommodations during the writing of the thesis. 

We would also like to thank Trondheim municipality's development team for their constant feedback and ideas.
